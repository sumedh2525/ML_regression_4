    "Lasso Regression, short for \"Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator,\" is a linear regression technique that incorporates L1 regularization. Lasso regression adds a penalty term to the linear regression's cost function, which is based on the absolute values of the coefficients of the features. This penalty encourages the model to not only fit the data well but also to keep the coefficient magnitudes small, effectively leading to feature selection.\n",
